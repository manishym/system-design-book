**Note**: All PRs must pass the automated test suite before merging. The CI pipeline will:
1. Run unit tests with coverage validation (â‰¥70% required)
2. Execute integration tests in a Kubernetes environment
3. Validate multi-user functionality and Redis integration

If tests fail, please review the output and update your changes accordingly.
